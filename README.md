COVID: The Escape

I created a game to teach kids about social distancing. Keeping a safe distance away from each other is a hard thing to do, especially for kids. That's why I created this game, in which you have to keep a 6 feet distance from the red germs at all times. Social Distancing has never been this FUN!
